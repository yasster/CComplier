# CComplier

## About
This a small C Compiler. Despite the complexity and the theory behind compiler, I've taken the challenge and understood the basic fundimentals on Complier design. 


## Running Code
```
gcc -o xc xc.c (you may need the -m32 option on 64bit machines)
./xc hello.c
./xc -s hello.c

./xc c4.c hello.c
./xc c4.c c4.c hello.c
```
